		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Question:</b>What are your names and tell us a little bit about yourselves?</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Answer:</b>F: My name is Fernanda. My love for baking began with a simple carrot cake made at the age of 8. I would bake with cake box mixes as a child, and as I grew older, I focused on gluten free and keto products. During my freetime, I enjoy watching any of the Real Housewives episodes and cuddling with my two dogs, Coco and Brownie.
		 Hi, I’m Andrea! I have a short background in nutrition, but always had a knack for sweets. I like calligraphy, photography, graphic designing, and eating dark chocolate! Since baking has always been a part of my life, I thought it’d be awesome to incorporate both nutrition and baking to create cakes that require less “guilty foods”. When I’m not in the kitchen, I like to dance, enjoy sunset views, and binge-watch on Netflix.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Question:</b>What made you both start this small local business?</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Answer:</b>Owning a baking business has been a dream of ours for a long time. It seemed impossible at first, but with a friend with the same passion, it worked out!</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Question:</b>What made you come up with the name Amidulce?</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Answer:</b>  We wanted to think of a name that described the idea of two friends baking together. "Ami-", or  amiga  meaning friend in Spanish, and  dulce , which translates to sweet in English. Put those together, you got Amidulce!<p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Question:</b>How would you differentiate yourselves from other small businesses in San Francisco?</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Answer:</b>Customer satisfaction is one of our biggest priorities. We love receiving feedback on our products. Therefore, we ensure that good quality and taste are given in each of our orders. For example, we've gotten a lot of comments about how difficult it can be to find a gluten free cake or pie that tastes just as good as one that is regular. With trial and error, we can guarantee that our gluten free options are just as delicious.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Question:</b>When did your small business launch?</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Answer:</b> February 2019</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Question:</b>Did you both receive any financial assistance from anyone to help the start up of your business?</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Answer:</b> Yes. Being young bakers, our financial support has sometimes had to come from our parents. They're our #1 cheerleaders!</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Question:</b>As far as customer service goes, do you both receive any help at all from anyone to run this business?</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Answer:</b> Yes, as an extension to the previous answer, our families has helped us in many ways other than financially. They help spread the word to friends, coworkers, and so forth. We receive tips and tricks from our tech savvy dads, and our moms are there for 24/7 support.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Question:</b>What is the average for sales in a day? Week? Month?</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Answer:</b>As a recently starting online business, we get about an order every week, or 4-5 per month. That would translate to a range of $200-300 per month depending on the price of each order.</p>
		<p style="text-align: left"><b>Question:</b>Why is the small local business, yet industry alone?</p>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>Answer:</b>It takes a while to be recognized as a business, especially since smaller businesses can be a shadow to the bigger ones. Thanks to social media though, it isn’t that difficult to appear on someone’s Instagram feed.</p>
